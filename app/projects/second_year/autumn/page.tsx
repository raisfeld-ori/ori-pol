    After realizing that lang-py was too large of a project, I decided to make a smaller compiler,
    one for my own programming language: dalet. A programming language in hebrew for new programmers,
    with compatibility with the language C. It had variables and classes and functions and all sorts of
    awsome stuff, but around that time my debian (linux distro) got currupted, and when reinstalling it,
    I accidentally deleted all of my old projects, including all of this project. I managed to recover
    the projects before this, but not this project. so sadly, there is nothing to show for all of that
    hard work. But, on the good side, this project did teach me a lot of valuable things, and showed
    me how important github is to my development. So ever since then, I did everything with tools like
    github to make sure my code is safe.
