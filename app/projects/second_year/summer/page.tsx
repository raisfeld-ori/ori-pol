    Unlike what I expected, the summer project was very small. So what did we do? well, we did 2 things,
    the first, more small thing, was to add settings to Ksed, so you can actually edit things like the
    background image or the volume. The larger thing started in a hackathon, we made a concept for an app 
    named Tiod that won the hackathon and earned 3,000â‚ª for the project! we decided to continue the project
    this summer and our goal is to hopefully, but the start of the next year, already release a demo.
